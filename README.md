# DnDCharacterApp

A final project for Mobile development. 
This is an app that allows user to create and store characters within a database. 
sUsers can come back and edit characters at any time and will witness realtime updates.

TO USE:
Launch the app and click on plus button in the upper right corner. Most pages do not have to be filled out completely (some do, the app will tell you if this is needed)
this is so users may come back to a character at any time and finish their creation. To advance through the adding process, click the arrows in the top right corner.
The stats page has a roll for stats option at the top that will fill in stats (NOTE: there is not an opportunity to do this again if it is not done now).
For pages where it makes sense to have multiple entries (i.e. abilities) a button is at the bottom that will allow users to enter multiple of that category. 
Once the home screen is back, the character will appear in a list, click on the name to access this character to access their information. 
Select which field to view using the spinner and press the go button. These pages will look very similar to what is seem when added but please not that they arrows in the top right have been removed
and replaced with three new buttons. The leftmost allows for updating, this button works on every page, the next button allows for adding, and the last, rightmost, button allows for clearing fields.
The last two buttons do not work on pages where they is only one of the field (i.e. character). Click the clear button to clear the fields, fill in the fields, and then click add to add them to your character.
To refresh, click the go button. To update an existing entry, do NOT press the clear button, rather edit the field(s) you wish to update then click the update button.
To refresh, click the go button. To return to the main screen, simply push the back button on your phone.
